# Lorentz-Force-Simulation
*Currently Unfinished*
A first revision of a program which will plot the path of a charge particle through a consistent magnetic field, constantly adjusting for changes in velocity.

This is the second part of a larger project which will be used to observe how particles of differentiating masses and charges will move through a magnetic field.
This evidence is a precursor to the building of a cloud chamber, in which different cosmic rays can be observed and identified.
