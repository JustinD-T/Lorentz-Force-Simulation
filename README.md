# Lorentz-Force-Simulation
*Currently Unfinished*
A first revision of a program which will plot the path of a charge particle through a consistent magnetic field, constantly adjusting for changes in velocity.

The program currently includes 3D MatPlotLib array mapping to visulaize magnetic field lines, and the completely from-scratch derivation of 3D vector decomposition through the use of trigonometry learned at a Gr.11 level. The program currently involves early versions of velocity and force calculations using instantaneous kinematics and the lorentz force, though it is still being bug-fixed.

This program excludes most calculus generally involved with such applications (as it has not been taught at my grade level), by splitting kinematic time-frames into near instantanous moments, which trends the calculation towards an answer much like a limit trends converges a number.

This is the second part of a larger project which will be used to observe how particles of differentiating masses and charges will move through a magnetic field.
This evidence is a precursor to the building of a cloud chamber, in which different cosmic rays can be observed and identified.
